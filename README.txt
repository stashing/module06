For the Power BI file to work on your machines, make sure the 
sources are updated.

In one table (say 6_cust):
0. Click on the 6_cust query on the left pane.
1. Go to Applied Steps -> Source
2. Click on the gear icon on the right.
3. A new window will appear, prompting you to change the location of
   the source file.
4. Again, for the Power BI file to work, your source needs to be
   updated. Go to "File Path" then click on "Browse". (see re_filepath_change.png)
5. Select the file corresponding to "6_cust" in your machine. Click OK.


- Do the same for 6_sales and rates.
- Once done, click "Close & Apply".
- Head over to "Refresh" to see the changes.
- Once done, you're good to go! Kapag di gumana, kindly let me know through Charles/Ms Candy and
  I'll try to help you sort things out. :)


Good luck and yakang-yaka yan,
JP
